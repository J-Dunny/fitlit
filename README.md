# FitLit
---



### Project Description

---

The FitLit app is a fitness app that allows the user to view a personal fitness profile with their data relating to sleep, hydration, and steps.  The user can add daily fitness information related to sleep, hydration and activivty that will update a local API.  We built this app with TDD.   A dashboard for viewing user data was built with HTML and CSS. THe data displayed was from a fetch API and we built multiple classes to structure it for display.  Prototype methods were used to iterate through the fetched data in each class in order to display desired info for the user.

### Built Using TDD

---

This app was created using Test Driven Development. Tests for desired functionality were written with Mocha and Chai before any Javascript. These test files are found in the `test` folder.  You can run the tests using `npm install` then `npm start` in the terminal after cloning the repo.
